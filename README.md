– Services over data instead of the resources
themselves (e.g., Uber does not own taxis,
AirBnB does not own houses/rooms)
– Business value is created entirely from data
(either generated, collected, or provided) ñ
Data has to be protected and managed well
at all costs
– Businesses cannot survive without secure,
accessible, and flexible data
– Database systems provide a universal
standardized way to store data (in a secure
way)
